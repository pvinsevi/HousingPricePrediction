# Housing Price Prediction
This repository contains a predictive model to estimate housing prices based on various features such as number of bedrooms, size of lot, and location. The model is developed using regression techniques and aims to provide accurate predictions to assist in making informed decisions in the real estate market..

## The Data
The data contains the housing prices sold from May 2014 to May 2015 from King County, Washington and housing prices from California sold in 2020. The model utilizes a comprehensive dataset comprising historical housing data. The dataset includes information such as location, square footage, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, amenities, and previous sales prices.

## Evaluation
The performance of the model is evaluated using metrics such as mean squared error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and R-squared. These metrics provide insights into the accuracy and reliability of the predictions.
